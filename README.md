backstory:
we are looking under a microscope at protozoans and bacteria.  we need to get rid of them and the only way to do it is with (these attacker guys) that need
to be spooked.  unfortunately if you fly out of the microscope you are lost forever.

todo:
should be simple to make the speed multiplier and max speed
different for each sprite.

how about an attack dog?  instead of eating the food, we disturb the attacker.  it zooms around
bumping baddies and killing them for a few seconds.  we will stay in attack mode for that time too.

score: number of ticks?  add something for each baddie killed?
