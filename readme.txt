todo:
can we remove the sprites once they have been added to static_sprites?  i dont think so?  at least not easily.  this would
be useful for collisions/food etc.  so we should move anything that might be killed to args.outputs.sprites << args.state.enemies, etc

let create a bunch of tiny brownian motion particles.  they can be in static sprites and will be two or three pixels long.
maybe let them "move" out of the way when there is a collision?
